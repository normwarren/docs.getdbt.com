The invocation_id is a unique identifier generated by dbt for each run of a dbt command. When you run dbt commands such as dbt run or dbt test, dbt generates an invocation_id for that specific run. This invocation_id is used to track the specific run in dbt artifacts and logs.

The invocation_id is helpful for debugging and auditing purposes. For example, if you encounter issues during a dbt run, you can refer to the logs and dbt artifacts associated with that specific invocation_id to diagnose problems and understand the context of the run.

By using the invocation_id, you can trace back the exact dbt run and review the relevant information related to that specific execution.The `invocation_id` outputs a UUID generated for this dbt command. This value is useful when auditing or analyzing dbt invocation metadata.

If available, the `invocation_id` is:
- available in the compilation context of [`query-comment`](/reference/project-configs/query-comment)
- included in the `info` dictionary in dbt [events and logs](/reference/events-logging#info)
- included in the `metadata` dictionary in [dbt artifacts](/reference/artifacts/dbt-artifacts#common-metadata)
- included as a label in all BigQuery jobs that dbt originates
